## Rootable numbers

If you add up uneven numbers, you'll always get a number that's fully rootable

```
1 + 3             = 4  => 2
1 + 3 + 5         = 9  => 3
1 + 3 + 5 + 7     = 16 => 4
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 => 5
```

And to add, the rooted numbers go up one by one

## Which unwhole number is bigger

```
2 3
_ _
3 4
```

Multiply crosses. Whichever top number multiplied by opposing low number is bigger, that whole number is bigger

## Percentages are reversible

6% of 50

is the same as

50% of 6

which is much easier to calculate
