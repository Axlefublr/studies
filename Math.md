## Rootable numbers

If you add up uneven numbers, you'll always get a number that's fully rootable

```
1 + 3             = 4  => 2
1 + 3 + 5         = 9  => 3
1 + 3 + 5 + 7     = 16 => 4
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 => 5
```

And to add, the rooted numbers go up one by one

## Which unwhole number is bigger

```
2 3
_ _
3 4
```

Multiply crosses. Whichever top number multiplied by opposing low number is bigger, that whole number is bigger

## Percentages are reversible

6% of 50

is the same as

50% of 6

which is much easier to calculate

## Factorial

A factorial number will always be divisible by the sum of its numbers

Up until 431, that is

4! = 24 => 2+4 = 6 => 24/6 = 4

## Primorial

Like factorial, but only prime numbers are multiplied

```cs
11# = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310
```

## Alternating factorial

```cs
af(4) = 4! - 3! + 2! - 1! = 19
```

## Hyperfactorial

```cs
H(4) = 1^1 * 2^2 * 3^3 * 4^4 = 27648
```

## Double factorial

Same parity (evenness or oddness)

```cs
3!! = 1 * 3 = 3
4!! = 2 * 4 = 8
```

## Explonental factorial

```cs
4^3^2 = 262144
5^4^3^2 = (has 183231 digits)
```
